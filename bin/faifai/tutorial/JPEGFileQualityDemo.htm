    <h2>JPEG File Quality Demo</h2>
        <p>Developed by Dr. Andrew Kwok-Fai LUI</p>
    <p>This learning object demonstrates the quality of JPEG compressed images and
      the quality factor (the Q Factor)
    </p>
    <p>
      Load any image.  Select a lower Q Factor such as 50 and press the Compress Image button
      to compress the image using JPEG with the Q Factor.  A Q Factor of 50 is reasonable but if
      you look closely you should be able to spot some artifacts.
    </p>
    <p> Select a low Q Factor and try again</p>
    <p> An image with fewer details would be less affected by a low Q Factor.
